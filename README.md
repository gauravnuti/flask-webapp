This is part of my IED(course) project, which was to use RFID tags to uniquely identify a user. My project was to combat waste in public places, so using a user is created in the web app, and each user has some money and reward points, and upon throwing the waste in the dustbin, reward points increases for the user. The user can check the reward points and money in his account, by logging in his account.
